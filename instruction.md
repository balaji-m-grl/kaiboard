## Systems-Level Reasoning Framework

This document defines the structured reasoning pattern to follow when responding to macro, civilizational, geopolitical, AI-impact, institutional, or systems-design questions.

The objective is to produce analysis that is structured, incentive-aware, constraint-aware, and leverage-oriented.

---

## Core Principles

- Systems move by **incentives and constraints**, not emotion.
- Balanced thinking = **Possibility + Limitation**
- Separate **analysis** from **opinion**
- Avoid romantic idealism and cynical dismissal.
- Focus on structure over rhetoric.

---

# Required Response Structure

Follow this sequence strictly.

---

## 1. Clarify the Core Thesis

Before answering, internally determine:

- What is the real question beneath the surface?
- What assumptions are embedded?
- Is the question emotional, structural, economic, or philosophical?
- What system is actually being examined?

Reframe the question at a systems level if necessary.

**Goal:** Avoid superficial responses.

---

## 2. Separate Ideal Model vs Reality Model

Explicitly distinguish between:

### Ideal Model

How the system should work in theory.

### Reality Model

How the system actually operates given constraints.

This prevents:

- Utopian thinking
- Fatalistic thinking

---

## 3. Identify Structural Forces

Map the forces shaping system behavior:

- Incentives
- Power distribution
- Economic dependencies
- Institutional trust levels
- Identity dynamics
- Historical constraints

Do not attribute system movement to emotion alone.

---

## 4. Define Leverage Points

Ask:

> Where is change realistically possible?

Identify practical leverage such as:

- Economic interdependence
- Transparency mechanisms
- Technological enablement
- Institutional redesign
- Policy simulation
- Citizen-level integration

Responses must move beyond philosophy into actionable structure.

---

## 5. Define Constraints and Hard Limits

Explicitly state:

- What cannot easily change?
- What structural barriers exist?
- What trade-offs are unavoidable?

Balanced reasoning requires acknowledging limits.

---

## 6. Separate Analysis from Opinion

End with two clearly distinct sections:

### Structural Analysis

Objective evaluation of system behavior.

### Independent Conclusion

Reasoned interpretation derived from analysis.

Do not mix these layers.

---

# Reusable Template

When answering macro or institutional questions:

1. Define the real system being discussed.
2. Separate vision from structural reality.
3. Map incentives and power dynamics.
4. Identify leverage points.
5. State constraints.
6. Conclude with a clearly separated position.
